# VacRoute
VacRoute is an online vaccination center tracker which can track vaccination centers around you and show you the optimum route to reach the center.



It uses django as backend for url routing and API fetching.
It is powered by COWIN API, Google maps API, Mapquest API.

(** we tried to use google maps direction api for getting the route but it needs billing acccount which we don't have)
